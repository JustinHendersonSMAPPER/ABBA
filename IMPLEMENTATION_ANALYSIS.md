  - Different biblical canons (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox)
  - Canon comparison and validation
  
- **Canon Service** (test_canon_service.py) - 92% coverage
  - Canon registry and management
  - Translation support between canons

### 3. Text Parsing ✅
- **Greek Parser** (test_greek_parser.py) - 97% coverage
  - Parse Greek biblical texts
  - Extract morphological information
  
- **Hebrew Parser** (test_hebrew_parser.py) - 96% coverage
  - Parse Hebrew biblical texts
  - Handle right-to-left text
  
- **Translation Parser** (test_translation_parser.py) - 98% coverage
  - Parse Bible translation JSON files
  - Normalize verse references

- **Lexicon Parser** (test_lexicon_parser.py) - 88% coverage
  - Parse biblical lexicons
  - Link words to meanings

### 4. Alignment Features ✅
- **Verse Mapper** (test_verse_mapper.py) - 86% coverage
  - Map verses between versification systems
  - Handle split/joined verses
  
- **Bridge Tables** (test_bridge_tables.py) - 88% coverage
  - Bridge different versification systems
  - Handle complex mappings

- **Unified Reference** (test_unified_reference.py) - 90% coverage
  - Create canonical verse references
  - Support multiple versification systems

- **Validation** (test_validation.py) - 93% coverage
  - Validate alignment mappings
  - Check data integrity

### 5. Cross References ✅
- **Cross Reference System** (test_cross_references.py) - Working
  - Parse biblical cross-references
  - Track citation relationships

### 6. Interlinear Support ✅
- **Interlinear Generator** (test_interlinear.py) - Working
  - Create interlinear text displays
  - Align original language with translations

## Areas Needing Implementation

### 1. Export System ❌ (All tests disabled)
The entire export system needs implementation or significant refactoring:
- SQLite export for mobile apps
- JSON export for static sites
- OpenSearch export for search functionality
- Graph database export (Neo4j, ArangoDB)

**Recommendation**: Start with SQLite export as it's the simplest and most useful for mobile apps.

### 2. Morphology System ❌ (0% coverage)
- Greek morphology parsing
- Hebrew morphology parsing
- Unified morphology interface

**Recommendation**: Implement basic morphology support for common parsing codes.

### 3. Timeline System ❌ (0% coverage, tests ignored)
- Timeline models and events
- Date parsing and uncertainty
- Timeline visualization

**Recommendation**: This is a complex feature that could be deferred.

### 4. Annotation System ❌ (Tests ignored)
- Topic annotation engine
- ML-based classification
- Quality control

**Recommendation**: Start with simple manual annotations before ML features.

### 5. Manuscript Support ❌ (Tests disabled)
- Manuscript variant tracking
- Critical apparatus support
- Manuscript scoring

**Recommendation**: This is specialized functionality that could be deferred.

### 6. Language Features ❌ (Tests disabled)
- RTL text handling
- Font support
- Transliteration
- Unicode utilities

**Recommendation**: Implement basic RTL support for Hebrew text.

## Priority Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Export (High Priority)
1. **SQLite Export**
   - Basic schema for verses, annotations, cross-references
   - FTS5 search support
   - Mobile-optimized structure

2. **Simple JSON Export**
   - Book/chapter/verse hierarchy
   - Minimal metadata
   - CDN-ready structure

### Phase 2: Basic Morphology (Medium Priority)
1. **Morphology Models**
   - Define morphology data structures
   - Basic parsing code support

2. **Integration**
   - Link morphology to verse text
   - Export morphology data

### Phase 3: Annotations (Medium Priority)
1. **Simple Annotations**
   - Manual topic tagging
   - Basic categorization
   - No ML features initially

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
- Timeline system
- Manuscript variants
- ML-based annotations
- Advanced language features

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Remove Over-Engineering**
   - Many classes have complex async interfaces that aren't needed
   - Simplify to synchronous operations where appropriate

2. **Fix Import Structure**
   - Clean up circular dependencies
   - Make optional dependencies truly optional

3. **Consistent API Design**
   - Standardize constructor patterns
   - Use consistent parameter names

4. **Documentation**
   - Add docstrings to implemented features
   - Create usage examples

## Conclusion

The ABBA project has a solid foundation with working parsers, verse identification, and canon support. The main gap is the export system, which is essential for making the data usable. By focusing on simple SQLite and JSON exports first, the project can deliver value quickly while deferring complex features like timelines and ML-based annotations.
