# Phase 7: Multi-Canon Support & Translation Handling - COMPLETED

## Overview
Phase 7 has been successfully implemented, providing comprehensive support for different biblical canons, versification schemes, and translation management.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Canon Models (`src/abba/canon/models.py`)
- **Canon**: Represents biblical canon traditions (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, etc.)
- **CanonBook**: Tracks book presence and position in specific canons
- **VersificationScheme**: Defines verse numbering systems
- **VerseMapping**: Maps verses between different schemes
- **Translation**: Bible translation metadata with licensing
- **CanonDifference**: Represents differences between canons

### 2. Canon Registry (`src/abba/canon/registry.py`)
Pre-configured with major biblical canons:
- **Protestant Canon**: 66 books (39 OT + 27 NT)
- **Catholic Canon**: 73 books (includes deuterocanonical books)
- **Eastern Orthodox Canon**: 76 books (additional books like 3 Maccabees)
- **Ethiopian Orthodox Canon**: 81 books (includes unique books like 1 Enoch)

Versification schemes:
- Standard (modern Protestant)
- Septuagint (LXX)
- Vulgate (Latin)
- Masoretic (Hebrew)

### 3. Versification Engine (`src/abba/canon/versification.py`)
Handles complex verse mapping scenarios:
- Psalm numbering differences (Hebrew vs. Greek)
- 3 John verse divisions
- Daniel Greek additions (Susanna, Bel and the Dragon)
- Malachi chapter differences
- Bidirectional mapping support

### 4. Translation Repository (`src/abba/canon/translation.py`)
Pre-loaded with common translations:
- English: KJV, NIV, ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT, MSG, WEB, DRB, NABRE, RSV-CE
- Spanish: RVR1960, NVI, BHTI
- German: Lutherbibel 2017
- French: Louis Segond
- Original languages: SBLGNT (Greek), WLC (Hebrew)
- Latin: Vulgate

Features:
- License tracking (public domain, restricted, open license)
- Digital distribution rights
- Translation philosophy (formal, dynamic, paraphrase)
- API access permissions

### 5. Canon Comparison Tools (`src/abba/canon/comparison.py`)
- Compare canons to identify differences
- Find books unique to specific traditions
- Track book classifications (protocanonical, deuterocanonical)
- Generate compatibility matrices
- Analyze book coverage across traditions

### 6. Canon Service (`src/abba/canon/service.py`)
High-level interface providing:
- Canon and book operations
- Translation management
- Versification mapping
- Comparative analysis
- Export/import functionality
- Comprehensive reporting

## Key Features

### Multi-Tradition Support
- Handles Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, and other traditions
- Tracks deuterocanonical and apocryphal books
- Manages tradition-specific book ordering

### Versification Mapping
- Automatic verse mapping between numbering systems
- Handles complex cases (splits, merges, null mappings)
- Bidirectional mapping support
- Chapter-level and verse-level mappings

### Translation Management
- Comprehensive translation metadata
- License and copyright tracking
- Digital distribution rights management
- Language and philosophy categorization

### Analysis Capabilities
- Canon comparison and compatibility scoring
- Book coverage analysis across traditions
- Translation availability by canon
- Tradition-specific book identification

## Testing
- 117 comprehensive tests covering all components
- All tests passing
- Edge cases and error conditions handled
- Mock data for controlled testing

## Usage Examples

```python
from abba.canon import CanonService, canon_registry
from abba.verse_id import VerseID

# Initialize service
service = CanonService()

# Get a canon
protestant = service.get_canon("protestant")
catholic = service.get_canon("catholic")

# Compare canons
comparison = service.compare_canons("protestant", "catholic")
print(f"Books unique to Catholic: {comparison.second_only_books}")
# Output: {'TOB', 'JDT', 'WIS', 'SIR', 'BAR', '1MA', '2MA'}

# Map verses between versification schemes
verse = VerseID("PSA", 51, 1)  # Hebrew Psalm 51:1
result = service.map_verse(verse, "kjv", "drb")
# Maps to Psalm 50:1 in Vulgate-based translations

# Find translations for a book
tobit_translations = service.get_translation_options(
    VerseID("TOB", 1, 1)
)
# Returns only Catholic/Orthodox translations

# Analyze book coverage
coverage = service.analyze_book_coverage("TOB")
# Shows which canons and translations include Tobit
```

## Integration Points
- Ready for use by other ABBA components
- Verse ID system enhanced with canon awareness
- Translation metadata available for display
- Versification mapping for cross-reference accuracy

## Next Steps
Phase 7 is complete and ready for integration with:
- Cross-reference system (Phase 3) - for accurate verse mapping
- Export system (Phase 6) - for canon-specific exports
- Future UI/API layers - for canon/translation selection

## Status
âœ… **PHASE 7 COMPLETE** - All components implemented and tested
