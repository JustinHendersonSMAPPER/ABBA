# ABBA Implementation Status

This document provides a comprehensive checklist of implemented and unimplemented features in the ABBA project, along with identified discrepancies between documentation and actual implementation.

## Summary

- **Overall Code Coverage**: 9% (far below the required 80%)
- **Test Status**: 519 tests collected, but 2 collection errors prevent full test suite execution
- **Major Issues**: Missing dependencies, disabled tests, and significant gaps between documented and actual implementation

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Environment Setup Issues
- [ ] **Fix PyTorch Installation**: `torch` is listed in dependencies but not properly installed
  - Blocks all ML-based annotation features
  - Causes `test_annotations.py` to fail
- [ ] **Fix Timeline Module Exports**: `Location` class not exported in `timeline/__init__.py`
  - Causes `test_timeline.py` to fail

### 2. Test Suite Problems
- [ ] **Re-enable Export Tests**: All export module tests are renamed to `.disabled`
- [ ] **Fix Test Collection Errors**: 2 modules fail to collect, preventing full test execution
- [ ] **Achieve 80% Test Coverage**: Currently at 9%

## Documentation vs. Implementation Discrepancies

### Major Discrepancies

1. **Phase Completion Claims**
   - Documentation claims Phases 1-5 and 7 are completed
   - Actual implementation shows most modules at 0% coverage
   - Only canon models/registry have substantial coverage (>80%)

2. **Test Count Mismatch**
   - IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md claims "514 passing tests"
   - Actual test run shows collection errors preventing execution
   - Cannot verify the claimed test count

3. **Export System Status**
   - Documentation says Phase 6 is "In Progress"
   - All export tests are disabled (renamed to `.disabled`)
   - Suggests significant implementation issues

4. **ML Features**
   - Documentation describes completed ML-based annotation features
   - Missing torch dependency prevents any ML functionality
   - All annotation module tests fail to collect

5. **Timeline Implementation**
   - Documentation claims Phase 5 is completed
   - Code exists but has very low coverage (9-51%)
   - Missing exports cause test failures

### Features Described but Not Implemented

1. **Manuscript Support**
   - All manuscript modules at 0% coverage
   - No evidence of variant handling implementation

2. **Morphology System**
   - All morphology modules at 0% coverage
   - No working Greek/Hebrew morphological analysis

3. **Interlinear Features**
   - All interlinear modules at 0% coverage
   - No token alignment or lexicon integration

4. **Cross-Reference System**
   - All cross-reference modules at 0% coverage
   - No citation tracking or classification

## Recommendations for Moving Forward

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues (Immediate)
1. [ ] Fix poetry environment and torch installation
2. [ ] Add missing exports to timeline module
3. [ ] Re-enable and fix export module tests
4. [ ] Verify actual test count and coverage

### Phase 2: Implement Core Features (Priority)
1. [ ] Complete basic parsers (Greek, Hebrew, translation)
2. [ ] Implement verse alignment system
3. [ ] Add basic morphology support
4. [ ] Create working export pipeline (at least SQLite and JSON)

### Phase 3: Add Advanced Features (Secondary)
1. [ ] Implement cross-reference system
2. [ ] Add timeline functionality
3. [ ] Enable ML-based annotations (after fixing dependencies)
4. [ ] Add manuscript variant support

### Phase 4: Complete Implementation (Long-term)
1. [ ] Implement search and query features
2. [ ] Add remaining language support features
3. [ ] Complete all export formats
4. [ ] Achieve 80% test coverage

## Code to Remove or Refactor

Based on the analysis, consider:

1. **Removing Stub Implementations**: Many modules have full code but 0% coverage, suggesting they may be untested stubs
2. **Consolidating Alignment Modules**: Three different aligner implementations with 0% coverage
3. **Simplifying Export Pipeline**: Current implementation seems over-engineered for the actual functionality

## Conclusion

The ABBA project has significant gaps between its documented status and actual implementation. While the architecture and design are well-documented, most core features lack working implementations. The immediate priority should be fixing the test environment and implementing basic functionality before attempting advanced features like ML-based annotations or complex alignment algorithms.
