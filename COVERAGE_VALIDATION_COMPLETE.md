# Coverage Validation Implementation Complete

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive alignment coverage validation tools to measure what percentage of a translation's vocabulary can be mapped back to the original languages (Hebrew/Greek).

## Components Created

### 1. Standalone Validation Script
**File**: `scripts/validate_alignment_coverage.py`
- Basic coverage calculation
- Command-line interface
- Generates detailed reports
- Supports minimum coverage thresholds

### 2. ABBA-Align Coverage Analyzer
**File**: `src/abba_align/coverage_analyzer.py`
- Advanced coverage analysis with Strong's integration
- Multiple metrics: token coverage, type coverage, frequency bands
- Part-of-speech analysis
- Verse-level statistics
- Detailed reporting

### 3. CLI Integration
**Updated**: `src/abba_align/cli.py`
- Added `coverage` command to ABBA-Align
- Integrated with existing alignment infrastructure
- Supports Hebrew and Greek source languages

### 4. Documentation
**File**: `docs/ALIGNMENT_COVERAGE_VALIDATION.md`
- Comprehensive guide on coverage validation
- Metric explanations and targets
- Usage examples
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

## Key Features

### Coverage Metrics

1. **Token Coverage**: Percentage of word occurrences that can be aligned
   - Target: >90% for modern translations
   - Measures actual usage coverage

2. **Type Coverage**: Percentage of unique words that can be aligned
   - Target: >80% for comprehensive alignment
   - Measures vocabulary breadth

3. **Frequency Band Analysis**:
   - High frequency (100+): Should have >95% coverage
   - Medium frequency (10-99): Should have >85% coverage
   - Low frequency (2-9): Should have >70% coverage
   - Hapax legomena (1): Should have >50% coverage

4. **Part-of-Speech Coverage**: Breaks down coverage by grammatical category

5. **Verse-Level Statistics**: Shows distribution of coverage across verses

## Usage Examples

### Command Line
```bash
# Basic coverage analysis
abba-align coverage \
    --translation translations/kjv.json \
    --source-language hebrew \
    --report kjv_coverage.txt

# With minimum threshold
abba-align coverage \
    --translation translations/niv.json \
    --source-language greek \
    --min-coverage 85 \
    --model models/greek_english.json
```

### Programmatic
```python
from abba_align.coverage_analyzer import AlignmentCoverageAnalyzer

analyzer = AlignmentCoverageAnalyzer(source_lang='hebrew')
stats = analyzer.analyze_translation_coverage('translations/esv.json')

print(f"Token Coverage: {stats['summary']['token_coverage']:.1f}%")
print(f"Type Coverage: {stats['summary']['type_coverage']:.1f}%")
```

### Standalone Script
```bash
python scripts/validate_alignment_coverage.py \
    --model models/hebrew_english_biblical.json \
    --translation translations/kjv.json \
    --min-coverage 80 \
    --verbose
```

## Sample Output

```
COVERAGE SUMMARY
========================================
Token Coverage: 90.2%
Type Coverage: 79.2%

COVERAGE BY WORD FREQUENCY
----------------------------------------
High frequency (100+):
  Types: 245/267 (91.8%)
  Tokens: 456,789/478,234 (95.5%)
Medium frequency (10-99):
  Types: 1,234/1,456 (84.7%)
  Tokens: 89,123/98,765 (90.2%)

TOP 30 UNCOVERED WORDS
----------------------------------------
 1. unto                 8,234 occurrences
 2. thereof              2,345 occurrences
 3. yea                  1,234 occurrences
```

## Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance**: Validates alignment models meet coverage requirements
2. **Gap Identification**: Shows which words need alignment improvements
3. **Translation Comparison**: Compare coverage across different Bible versions
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor improvements as models are enhanced
5. **User Confidence**: Ensures end users can trace most text to originals

## Integration with ABBA

The coverage validation integrates seamlessly with:
- Strong's Concordance mappings
- IBM Model 1 alignments
- Morphological analysis
- Biblical phrase detection
- Verse-level alignment data

## Next Steps

To improve coverage:
1. Analyze uncovered high-frequency words
2. Add manual alignments for archaic terms
3. Expand training corpus
4. Leverage parallel passages
5. Enhance Strong's mappings

This implementation provides comprehensive tools for validating that alignment models achieve sufficient coverage of translation vocabulary, ensuring biblical text alignment systems maintain strong connections between translations and original languages.
