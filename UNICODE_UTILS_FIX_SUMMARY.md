# Unicode Utils Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. HebrewNormalizer.strip_hebrew_points
**Problem**: The method was not removing all Hebrew points, specifically:
- Dagesh (U+05BC)
- Shin dot (U+05C1) 
- Sin dot (U+05C2)

**Solution**: 
- Added `HEBREW_OTHER_POINTS` set containing these additional points
- Created `HEBREW_ALL_POINTS` set combining vowels, accents, and other points
- Modified `strip_hebrew_points` to use `HEBREW_ALL_POINTS` when stripping all points (default behavior)

### 2. GreekNormalizer.normalize_breathing_marks
**Problem**: The method was returning text in NFD (decomposed) form even when the input was in NFC (composed) form, causing test assertions to fail.

**Solution**:
- Added logic to detect the input normalization form (NFC or NFD)
- Modified the method to return text in the same normalization form as the input
- Ensures precomposed Greek characters like '·ºê' (U+1F10) are preserved when input is NFC

### 3. UnicodeValidator.validate_text
**Problem**: The validator was too strict about mixed scripts, flagging texts with Latin, Hebrew, and Greek as invalid.

**Solution**:
- Increased the allowed script count from 2 to 3 for biblical texts
- Added more nuanced validation that only flags:
  - More than 3 scripts
  - Unknown scripts mixed with 2+ known scripts
- This allows common biblical text combinations (Latin + Hebrew + Greek)

## Test Results
All 25 tests in test_unicode_utils.py now pass successfully.
